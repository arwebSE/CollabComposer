This is a multi-track piano-roll-style song editor app with an emphasis on music theory,
where notes and chords are color-coded according to the key, and some editing tools
work diatonically.

The app can currently import `.mid` and its own `.ttproj` project files,
which are in plain JSON format.
It can currently export `.ttproj` files and render `.wav` files.

Several soundfonts are readily available from an online repository.
